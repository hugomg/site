<h2>libscript</h2>

<p>
<strong>libscript</strong> is a plugin-based library designed to add
language-independent extensibility to applications.
</p>

<p>
It allows to decouple an application from the virtual machines provided by the
various scripting languages. The main library, <em>libscript</em>, is a thin layer that provides a
language-independent scripting API, allowing the application to register its
functions and invoke code to be performed. Libscript then invokes the
appropriate plugin (<em>libscript-python</em>, <em>libscript-ruby</em>, <em>libscript-lua</em>, etc.)
to run the code. This way, the application can support all those scripting
languages without adding each of them as a dependency.

<strong>libscript</strong> was developed by <a
href="http://hisham.hm">Hisham Muhammad</a> as a case study for
his MSc dissertation at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-RIO</a>.
