<h2>Lua2IL, a Lua to CIL compiler</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
		  
<p>Lua2IL compiles scripts written in the <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> language to
Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) assemblies. The compiler generates pure managed Common
Intermediate Language (CIL) code. Besides compiling scripts to CIL, Lua2IL also lets them
interface with CLI objects written in other languages.</p>
					
<p>For an interpreted language, Lua2IL generates efficient code, with the code being
about three times faster than similar JScript code compiled by the Microsoft JScript.NET
compiler bundled with .NET Framework 1.1 (without type optimizations).</p>

<p>A paper about the Lua2IL compiler was published in a special edition of the
<a href="http://www.jucs.org">Journal of Universal Computer Science</a>. You can read the paper
<a href="lua2il_jucs.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Lua2IL is designed and implemented by Fabio Mascarenhas.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
		  
<p>The compiler is a prototype. It compiles the full Lua 5.0 language, but doesn't include
most of the Lua standard library. You can download Lua2IL <a href="lua2il-0.5.zip">here</a>.</p>
