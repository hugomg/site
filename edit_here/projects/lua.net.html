<h2>Lua.NET: Integrating Lua with the CLI</h2>
 
<p><a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> is a scripting language not totally
unlike Tcl, Perl, or Python. Like Tcl, Lua is an "embedded language", in the
sense that embedding the interpreter into your program is a trivial task, and
it is very easy to interface Lua with other languages like C, C++, or even
Fortran. Like Python, Lua has a clear and intuitive syntax. Like all those
three, Lua is an interpreted language with dynamic typing, and with several
reflexive facilities.</p>

<p>What sets Lua apart from those languages is its portability, simplicity,
and small size. Lua is written in ANSI C, and runs without modifications in
almost any platform (MS-DOS, all versions of Windows, all flavors of Unix,
plus X-Box, PlayStation II, OS/2, BeOS, EPOC, etc.). The whole program lua.exe
has less than 200 Kbytes. Its simplicity led other groups to adopt Lua as a
scripting language for other scripting languages (see, for instance, <a
href="http://ruby-lua.unolotiene.com">Ruby-Lua</a>).</p>

<p>Currently, Lua has a strong presence whenever programmers need a light,
efficient, and portable language. It is being used by some tens of thousands
programmers around the world, both in research and in industrial projects. Lua
has been successfully used in games (e.g. Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey
Island, MK2, Baldur's Gate), in robots (e.g. Crazy Ivan, that won the Danish
RoboCup in 2000 and 2001), and several other applications (e.g. a
hot-swappable Ethernet switch (CPC4400), a genetic sequence visualization
system (GUPPY), "The most Linux on one floppy disk" (tomsrtbt)). An extended
list of applications using Lua can be found <a
href="http://www.lua.org/uses.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Lua.NET project integrates Lua with the <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/programming/clr/">Common Language
Infrastructure</a>, a framework for language interoperability. This
integration allows Lua to act both as a "client" language and as a "server"
language, although with a limited capacity for the latter. As a client, Lua
scripts can access components available through the CLI. As a server, Lua
scripts can implement new components accessible by other languages integrated
with the CLI.<p>

<p>Because Lua is an interpreted language with dynamic typing, its integration
with the CLI demands a dynamic nature. Lua.NET employs two approaches for this
integration. The first uses the same techniques used to implement <a
href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luaorb">LuaOrb</a>, a scripting tool that
canaccess and implement CORBA, COM and Java components. The approach is
implemented by the <a href="luainterface/">LuaInterface</a> library.</p>

<p>The second approach compiles Lua to the CLI's Common Intermediate Language,
instead of its own bytecode representation. This approach is implemented by
the <a href="lua2il/">Lua2IL</a> compiler.</p>
