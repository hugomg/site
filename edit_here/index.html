<h2>News</h2>

This was our second year in 
<a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/lablua">
Google Summer of Code</a>, and we had a very
succesful outcome, with six completed projects. Five of them were selected
from our <a href="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/ideas2015.html">Ideas' List</a>,
and one was proposed by the student herself. We were happy to
see that our students contributed not only with coding,
but also with creative input on the design of their projects.
