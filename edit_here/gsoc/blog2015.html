<a href="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br">LabLua</a>
is a research laboratory at the 
<a href="http://www.puc-rio.br">Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio)</a>,
affiliated with its Computer Science Department</a>.
It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on 
the <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua language</a>.
Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, scripting language, currently used in several domains, from embedded systems to games and Web development. 
<p>
2015 was our second year in Google Summer of Code (GSoC), and we had a very
succesfull outcome, with six completed projects. Five of them were selected
from our <a href="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/ideas2015.html">Ideas' List</a>,
and one was proposed by the student herself.
Here is a brief highlight of these projects:
<p>
<b>Port Lua Test Suite to NetBSD Kernel</b>
(<a href="https://github.com/gmesalazar/kerneltest">Guilherme Salazar</a>)
<p>
The Lua interpreter was initially ported to the 
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> kernel during GSoC 2010,
allowing users to <a href="http://netbsd.org/~lneto/dls14.pdf">write kernel extensions using Lua scripts</a>.
During GSoC 2015, Guilherme Salazar worked on porting the 
<a href="http://www.lua.org/tests/">Lua test suite</a> 
to the NetBSD kernel. He adapted test scripts to
eliminate dependencies on floating-point numbers and the operating
system itself. Guilherme also ported and reimplemented part of the
Lua standard libraries (e.g., math and io) for satisfying test
dependencies. Moreover, he found important bugs on the Lua kernel
port (which is the ultimate purpose of testing software ;-)).

<b>Elasticsearch Lua client (elasticsearch-lua)</b>
(<a href="https://github.com/DhavalKapil/elasticsearch-lua">Dhaval Kapil</a>)
<p>
Elasticsearch is a distributed and scalable search engine written in Java that,
besides the transport protocol (Java to Java), offers a very complete REST API 
accessed through JSON. 
Dhaval built an initial client for the Lua language following a model 
similar to other existing clients, such as the clients written in Python 
and PHP.
Dhaval had freedom to decide the programming model (object oriented) and how 
to build tests during development and did a good job. 
By using the elasticsearch-lua client, 
a programmer can access most Elasticsearch
functionalities, such as index, read, update, delete, and search documents. 
Moreover, elasticsearch-lua does proper load balancing across all nodes with 
pluggable and multiple selection strategies, implements a connection pool 
and offers the reindex feature (not available in Elasticsearch). 
Finally, this client tries to keep everything flexible and configurable.

<b>Port an SDL-based C++ open source game to Céu</b>
(<a href="https://github.com/Tkachov/ceu_pingus">Alexander Tkachov</a>)
<p>
<a href="http://ceu-lang.org/">Céu</a> is a programming language that
targets the development of reactive applications such as video games.
It features first-class support for events and parallel compositions for lines
of execution.
For this project, we wanted to port an open source game of considerable size from 
C++ to Céu.
Alexander chose the game Pingus (a Lemmings clone for
Linux) with a code base of around 40k lines of code.
An important requirement of our project was to do a "live port" of the game,
in which the original game kept 100% of its functionality during the porting
process.
Therefore, Alexander had to cope with two main challenges:
apply the Céu idioms to the new code and
keep the old C++ code working across the language boundaries.
Even though the code base was too big for a 3-month period,
Alexander ported around half of the game, including its core
(i.e., the game levels).

<b>Add support for WSDL generation to LuaSOAP</b>
(<a href="https://github.com/DiasVictor/luasoap">Victor Dias</a>)
<p>
<a href="http://tomasguisasola.github.io/luasoap">LuaSOAP</a>
is a library to ease the use of SOAP. It provides a very simple 
API that converts Lua tables to and from XML documents. 
It offers two modules to help providing (server) and consuming (client) 
SOAP services.
Victor developed another module to help the generation of 
WSDL documents for the services implemented by the server.
This new module traverses the service description (a Lua table, 
built by the programmer by hand, because Lua doesn't have this kind 
of information) and produces the WSDL description for it.
This new module will be integrated into LuaSOAP next version.

<b>Design of TIER encoding and its implementation in Lua</b>
(<a href="https://github.com/TheFlyingFiddle/TIER">Lukas Borin</a>)
<p>
TIER is an experimental language-independent binary encoding format, similar
in purpose to formats like XML, JSON and Google's Protocol Buffers. 
TIER is designed to optionally support self-describing encodings that 
include meta-information about the serial structure of the encoded data; 
this meta-information can be used to support dynamic verifications or 
automatic decoding. 
Lukas improved TIER's design and also wrote the first implementation of a 
Lua library that provides support for TIER encodings. 
He also wrote TIER's basic documentation and some tutorials on its usage. 
The TIER library supports custom mappings of the various TIER serial 
structures to specific Lua values. On top of this custom mapping support, 
Lukas also developed some predefined mappings for usual Lua values and a 
framework to facilitate the creation of mappings for usual Lua structures, 
such as sequences, maps, sets, etc. Moreover, Lukas also developed a 
collection of mappings to automatically translate Lua values into TIER 
encodings and vice-versa, using different approaches 
to preserve structure of the original Lua value in the encoded stream.

<b>Improvements to the Sailor Web Framework</b>
(<a href="https://github.com/Etiene/sailor">Etiene Dalcol</a>)
<p>
Sailor is an MVC web framework for Lua and LuaJIT. Its
distinguishing feature is that it easily lets the programmer
write Lua code for running both in the server and in the
browser. During GSoC 2015, Etiene 
worked on three fronts for improving the framework: the first
was a better test suite, the second was better documentation
for the project, and the third has been improvements for
the feature of running Lua code on the browser, with the
possibility of having Lua code in the browser request new
modules on demand from the server, and breaking the original
dependency on also having node.js installed on the server.
All of the GSoC contributions are already committed to the
<a href="https://github.com/Etiene/sailor">
Sailor project repository at Github</a>,
and the test suite is already part of Sailor 0.4, the latest
public release of the project.
