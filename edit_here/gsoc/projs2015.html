<h4 id="briefexplanation">Brief explanation</h4>

<p><a href="http://luarocks.org">LuaRocks</a>
is a package manager for
Lua modules. Since version 1.0, the format of the package
specification file (rockspec) was unchanged, in the name of
compatibility. For the next major release of LuaRocks, we intend to
make a backward-compatible revision to the format. However, instead of
guessing which features will be needed in the forthcoming years, the
idea is to make the format extensible through <i>add-ons</i>, as
discussed in this <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiZqfpZLSA8">Lua Workshop 2014
talk</a>.

<p>There are two sides to making an application extensible: defining
hooks to the application where extensions will plug into, and defining
a public API, which is the parts of the application that the
extensions will see/access.

<p>This includes major design work, and the student is not expected to do
this alone: the design part will be discussed with the mentor and the
LuaRocks community at large through the <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/luarocks-developers">LuaRocks
mailing list</a>. The coding part, of course, is up to the student.

<p>The best way to evaluate new APIs is to put them to work: the second
phase of the project will be to write some add-ons, to exercise the
new features. Two features that are often requested by the community
are support for running tests and generating documentation files:
these would make great add-ons.

<h4 id="expectedresults">Expected results</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extending the LuaRocks rockspec reader to allow new entries
created by add-ons</li>
<li>A system of hooks in LuaRocks to trigger actions programmed by add-ons</li>
<li>A sandbox environment for presenting a restricted API to add-ons</li>
<li>Add-ons for running tests and generating documentation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="briefexplanation">Brief explanation</h4>

<a href="http://www.netbsd.org">The NetBSD Operating System</a>
has a kernel-level Lua interpreter version for
<a href="http://netbsd.org/~lneto/dls14.pdf">scripting its kernel</a>.
For example, it allows users to
<a href="http://netbsd.org/~lneto/eurobsdcon14.pdf">filter packets using Lua
scripts</a>.
<p>
The main difference between kernel Lua and regular user-level Lua
is that kernel Lua doesn't have support for standard libraries that depend on
operating system (e.g., io and os) and for floating-point numbers.
The purpose of this project is to port
the <a href="http://www.lua.org/tests/">Lua Test Suite</a>
to NetBSD kernel.
That is,
to adapt scripts from Lua test suite and
develop a <a
href="http://www.home.unix-ag.org/bmeurer/NetBSD/howto-lkm.html">NetBSD
loadable kernel module</a> containing the C portion of Lua test suite.

<h4 id="expectedresults">Expected results</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adapted test scripts for kernel Lua</li>
<li>Kernel module for testing the
<a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#4">Lua C API</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="briefexplanation">Brief explanation</h4>

<p><a href="http://elasticsearch.com/">Elasticsearch</a>
is a distributed and scalable search engine.
It is written in Java and, besides the transport protocol (Java to
Java), it offers a very complete REST API accessed through
<a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a></p>

<p>Elasticsearch clients for different scripting languages such as Python, PHP
and Perl have already been developed.
However, a client for <a href="http://lua.org/">Lua</a>
is still not available.

<p>This project aims to create a complete Lua client to access Elasticsearch.


<h4 id="expectedresults">Expected results</h4>
<ul>
<li>A complete Lua client to access the Elasticsearch REST API.
</ul>

About Céu
</h4>

Céu is a programming language that targets system-level development of reactive 
systems.
<p>
For a little introduction about the language, please watch the video in our front page:
<br>

<p>
Céu appeared last year on "StrangeLoop" and the "Future Programming Workshop":

<h4 id="briefexplanation">Brief explanation</h4>

Port to Céu an existing C++ open source game of considerable size (30-50k lines of code).

<h3 id="luasoap">Add support for WSDL generation to LuaSOAP</h3>
<h4 id="student">Student</h4>
Victor Dias - Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brasil.
<h4 id="mentor">Mentor</h4>
<p>Tomás Guisasola</p>

<h4 id="briefexplanation">Brief explanation</h4>

<p><a href="http://tomasguisasola.github.io/luasoap/">LuaSOAP</a> is a library to
ease the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">SOAP</a>.  LuaSOAP provides
a very simple API that convert Lua tables to and from XML documents.
It also offers a simple way to invoke remote Web Services without having
to deal directly with SOAP messages.  In fact, LuaSOAP also provides
a simple way to offer Web Services -- the server side -- but it lacks
support for WSDL generation of the offered services.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL</a> is an XML format for describing
network services.  It is used to describe operations and messages --
with its types -- offered by Web Services.  Since Lua code does not
include type information, automatic generation has to be based on some
kind of hand-made declarative information.</p>

<h4 id="expectedresults">Expected results</h4>
<ul>
<li>Define the format to describe complementary WSDL information in Lua</li>
<li>Implement an automatic generator of WSDL documents</li>
<li>Test and document everything</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dynserial">Develop a binary serialization format with support for dynamically types values and an RPC protocol for dynamically typed invocations based on this format.</h3>
<h4 id="student">Student</h4>
Lukas Borin - Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.
<h4 id="mentor">Mentor</h4>
<p>Renato Maia</p>

<h4 id="briefexplanation">Brief explanation</h4>

<p>Most RMI protocols available today are either focused on inefficient 
representation formats for typing information (e.g.
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CORBA/3.3/Interoperability/PDF">
GIOP/IIOP (CORBA)</a>,
<a href="http://hessian.caucho.com">Hessian</a>,
<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">
Google Protocol Buffers</a>)
or on invocations where the typing information are predefined and static, 
therefore are absent on the data sent through the wire 
(e.g.
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">SOAP</a>,
<a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>,
<a href="http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.0/protocols/burlap.xtp">Burlap</a>).
<p>
Few protocols are designed to work efficiently with typed data. Invocations with typed data work well with the RPC model because it allows the identification of deployment problems (mismatch interfaces) and facilitate the dynamic evolution of distributed systems. A protocol for dynamically typed RPC should be based on a efficient serialization format for typed data, that is, information about how the data should be interpreted.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to design and implement a serialization binary serialization format with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Primitive data: numeric formats (integer and floating-point), characters and boolean.</li>
<li>Structured data: serialization of usual structured data like records, arrays, maps, tuples, union, etc.</li>
<li>Optional typing: serialization of both raw data and data plus typing information.</li>
<li>Structural compatibility: type information should allow to efficiently verify whether two types are compatibile.</li>
<li>Opaque data: allow that a special form of raw data (without typing information) can be ignored without compromising the remains of the stream and that can also be passed along by a receiver that did not interpreted it.</li>
<li>Semantic information: data types that can extend a standard type with additional semantic information, like a string (sequence of characteres) with an associated charset or a record with an associated class name that provides some behavior over the data on the record.</li>
<li>Graphs: data with cyclic references.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="expectedresults">Expected results</h4>

<ul>
<li>An specification of a binary serialization format with support for typed data.</li>
<li>An implementation of a library for encoding values using this format.</li>
</ul>
